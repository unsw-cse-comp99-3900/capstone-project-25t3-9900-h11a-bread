talk about transformation in 3D environment
which is an easy and at the same time important
concept and finally we will write a simple code in
Blueprints.
For running Unreal Engine, you need to use Epic Game
Launcher, but why Epic Game Launcher?
Actually, Epic Game Launcher is something like Steam.
It's not something that is designed for unreal Engine or
for for a specific application.
Epic Game has different products and to run Epic Game
products either for downloading the games or for running
the other 3D modeling applications, you should use this launcher
so it's not something that is designed just for unreal engine.

Oh . You don't type , so when you don't type , it can decrease [ __ ] of errors . And you don't need to be expert in programming . If you are not a professional programmer . Definitely blueprint will be easier for you . Definitely you need to know all object oriented programming . You need to be familiar with the principles of programming , but the knowledge of programming that you need to have is not . As I mean , it's not . It's not as necessary as C++ . Definitely . You can have you can be in intermediate level , but for C++ in unreal , you should be really expert regarding disadvantages of blueprints . In older versions of blueprint . Before version five , it was not as powerful as C++ . You couldn't do some optimizations . You couldn't . You had some limitations . But from Unreal Engine version five it is almost around 95% equal to C++ , so it has the necessary power that you need to develop your application . And when you use C++ , you have more freedom because you write everything yourself . So you are not limited to the nodes . And the other point is that if you are not good in node based programming , if you don't consider object oriented principles in your code , it can make understanding your code and interpretation of the nodes difficult for the people who want to debug or check your code . At the end of the day you will have many nodes . They are connected with each other and they are not understandable for yourself and for other people . I mean for the other members of your team to check your code , but based on the concepts that I will teach you in the course , you will learn how to group them , how to make functions classes so that you can make a tidy code , which is understandable for yourself and the other members of the team . Regarding advantages and disadvantages of C++ . First of all , since you are familiar with C++ , you don't need to learn a new language and you've already learned it from the other courses . you know So the syntax , you know the overall structure . And in theory , C++ is faster . But as I said in theory , but in practice , most of the times it doesn't work properly . And you need to restart Unreal Engine a couple of times . But blueprint has a better integration with Unreal Engine . For C++ , you should use Visual Studio . Net , which is another application , and it should have a connection between I mean , there should be a connection between Unreal Engine and Visual Studio , and sometimes it makes your Unreal Engine is slow . But blueprint is integrated into the heart of Unreal Engine , so it's not a separate application . And regarding disadvantages , it's not as safe as it's not as safe as blueprints , because in blueprints you're working with nodes . And those nodes [ __ ] [ __ ] specific settings . But in Unreal Engine , sorry . In C++ , since you write everything yourself , there is a higher chance of errors . Here you can see the interface of Unreal Engine . This part is called your viewport or your scene area . You make your application here . For example , here I added a table and two chairs and we have a floor and a sky . So in this part you can see the environment that you are working on . This section is used to add new elements to your application . For example , if you want to add lighting , if you want to add visual effects , if you want to add geometric shapes , you can add all of them through this section . If you can't see this section here , you should click this button and you can get all these features from this button here .
